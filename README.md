## 3. Data Preparation
***
In this section, we outline the steps taken to prepare the raw data for analysis. Proper data preparation is essential for ensuring that the dataset is in a suitable format and quality for downstream analysis. Below, we provide instructions, code, comments, and justifications for each data preparation step.
***

***
Exploring the dataset at the beginning allows us to understand its structure and content. This helps in making informed decisions about data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
The dataset comprises Twitter data, with each row representing a tweet along with associated information. 
* It includes columns such as **tweet_text**, which contains the text content of the tweets, **emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at**, specifying the brand or product to which the tweet's emotion is directed, and **is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product**, categorizing the sentiment expressed in each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral towards a brand or product. 
* The dataset appears to encompass a diverse range of emotions and sentiments, potentially related to various brands and products. The sentiment labels will serve as the target variable for sentiment analysis, making this dataset well-suited for exploring public sentiment towards different entities. 
* However, further exploration of the entire dataset is necessary to understand its size, sentiment distribution, and the specific brands or products covered, enabling more informed data preparation and analysis.

***

***
Upon initial inspection of our dataset, it was found that there were missing values in the emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at column. These missing values represented tweets that lacked explicit sentiment information toward any brand or product. As part of the data preprocessing phase, it is ideal to address these missing values to ensure a comprehensive and well-handled dataset for sentiment analysis.

* Retaining "No Emotion" as a Category: In the first step, we chose to keep "No Emotion toward brand or product" as a valid category in the emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at column. This decision was motivated by the need to distinguish between tweets expressing neutral sentiments and those genuinely lacking sentiment labels. By retaining this category, we preserve the nuances of neutral sentiments, which could be valuable for our analysis.

* Imputing Missing Values with "Unknown": In the second step, we implemented a data imputation strategy by filling the missing values in the emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at column with the placeholder category "Unknown." This approach ensures that all data points are retained while clearly indicating that these tweets lack specific sentiment information. Imputing with "Unknown" maintains dataset integrity and transparency in handling missing sentiment labels.

* Vectorization:

The project Utilized TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert the preprocessed text data into numerical features.
